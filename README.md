Q. How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

A. Graceful degradation and service workers are related because service workers help address the lower levels with grace. We can make our whole "complex" application, but we have to make sure it can work even in not the most ideal conditions, i.e. degradation of conditions. Service workers help get networked requests and cache responses allowing the website to work with poor or no internet connectivity. Thus, this gives the users a _graceful_ experience even when they are offline.
